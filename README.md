# Web Development

This basic project is part of my Web Development course on Udemy (taught by Angela Yu).

The focus here is on JavaScript and not HTML/CSS. My aim is to showcase how I have applied JavaScript code and also showcase my workflow through commit messages.

I have added this web application to Github Pages: https://slothexpress.github.io/samis-drums-js/
